ARM and x86 hooking framework for love live school idol
festival EN and JP

![](https://i.imgur.com/zcmcjD5.png)

this is a proxy/stub library for libjniproxy.so. it can be
used to easily read memory, hook, and call the
game's functions from within the game process without
relying on LD_PRELOAD or existing hooking frameworks

it comes with some hooks that log calls for crypto
function and a few others as well as printing the lua
stacktrace for functions called from lua

(update: it now also logs http traffic on JP)

rationale: I couldn't get LD_PRELOAD to work on my qemu
android x86 virtual machine and I'm too lazy to use a real
android device lol

NOTE: it's highly recommended that you compile this from
source and check the code yourself, as malicious code could
be easily injected through it. always get binaries
and source from a trusted source (in this case my github,
Francesco149). never share the logcat from this tool
with other people, it may contain your account and device
information!

compile and install the built-in hooks
-----------------------------------------------------------
compiling is linux-only for the time being. if you're a
windows user and know how to set a build up, feel free to
write a guide and pull request

```sh
chmod +x ./build
CC=~/arm/bin/clang CFLAGS=-DJNIPROXY_EN ./build
# change clang path to where your arm or x86 compiler is
# also change JNIPROXY_EN to JNIPROXY_JP if compiling for JP

adb root
adb shell

cd /data/app/klb.lovelive_en-1/lib/arm/
# remember to omit the _en suffix and use x86 instead of
# arm if working with the JP ver

mv libjniproxy.so libjniproxy.so.bak
exit
adb push libjniproxy.so /data/app/klb.lovelive_en-1/lib/arm/
adb shell

cd /data/app/klb.lovelive_en-1/lib/arm/
# remember to change arm to x86 if targeting x86

chmod 755 libjniproxy.so
chown system:system libjniproxy.so

# start the game and do whatever you need to log

adb shell logcat -d | grep jniproxy
```

framework
-----------------------------------------------------------
example that hooks CAndroidRequest::getRandomBytes

read the declarations at the top of jniproxy.c for more
information

myhook.c

```c
static int hooks_init();

#define JNIPROXY_EN
#define JNIPROXY_IMPLEMENTATION
#define JNIPROXY_MONOLITHIC
#define JNIPROXY_INIT hooks_init
#include "jniproxy.c"

#define sig(name) int name(void* this, uint8_t* data, int n)

typedef sig(func);
static func* trampoline = 0;

static sig(hook)
{
    int res;
    char* buf = 0;
    size_t nb = 0;

    log("> called from %p", __builtin_return_address(0));
    res = trampoline(this, data, n);
    log_bytes("data", data, n, &buf, &nb);
    free(buf);

    return res;
}

static
int hooks_init()
{
    int err;
    void* base = m_base("libGame.so",
        "app_klb_android_GameEngine_PFInterface_frameFlip");

    if (!base) {
        return -1;
    }

    m_hook("CAndroidRequest::getRandomBytes",
        base, 0, (void*)0x003490A0, 0, 0,
        (void**)&trampoline, hook);

    return 0;
}
```

build

```sh
#!/bin/sh

CFLAGS="-fPIC $CFLAGS"
LDFLAGS="-shared -llog -ldl $LDFLAGS"
$CC $CFLAGS myhook.c $LDFLAGS -o libjniproxy.so

```
